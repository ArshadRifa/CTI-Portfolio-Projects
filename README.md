# CTI-Portfolio-Projects
Welcome to my **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** project portfolio. This repository showcases practical assignments, reports, and analysis I have conducted as part of my transition into the cybersecurity field — with a strong focus on CTI.

## Goals
- Apply CTI concepts in real-world threat detection and intelligence.
- Continue expanding this portfolio with IOC enrichment, research, malware campaign analysis, and threat intel briefs.
- Contribute meaningfully to the CTI community and grow into a full-time CTI analyst role.

## Proects (/continued list/)
[Threat Actor Profiling]
- Researched nation-state threat actor - APT28 etc...
- Mapped TTPs using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Created structured threat reports with IOCs and campaign details.


## About Me
I hold a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity from the **University of Skövde, Sweden**, where I focused my thesis research on **Cyber Threat Intelligence**. Prior to that, I worked for 4+ years as a **Product Manager** in the technology sector.

Now, I am building my career in cybersecurity with a specialization in CTI — aiming for roles such as **Threat Intelligence Analyst**, **Threat Researcher**, or **CTI Consultant**.

This portfolio serves as a record of my hands-on learning and demonstrates my ability to analyze, correlate, and report on cyber threats.
